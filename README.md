# Async Utilities in Python

This project provides a set of utilities for managing asynchronous operations in Python. It includes:

- `async-sleep`: An asynchronous sleep function.
- `async-request`: A utility for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
- `async-race-condition`: A demonstration of handling race conditions in asynchronous code.

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Async Sleep

Run the script to see the differences in execution times for synchronous and asynchronous operations.

```bash
python async-sleep.py
```


### 2. Async Request

Make non-blocking HTTP requests with `httpx`.

```bash
python async-request.py
```

### 3. Async Race Condition

Demonstrate and manage race conditions in asynchronous code.

```bash
python async-race-condition.py
```
